# ESP-PROG Programming Cable Adapter
Simple PCB that sits on top of the ESP-PROG and enables you to use either the SOICbite or Tag-Connect TC2050-IDC to program your ESP-based projects.
 
### Features
* Enables connecting TC-2050-IDC and SOICbite programming cables to ESP-PROG for JTAG and UART programming. 
* This enables you to use component-less programming footprints easily on your ESP-based projects.   

## Notes and Usage
* Schematic, BOM, Gerbers, and all other files needed for production and assembly can be found attached to the latest [release!](https://github.com/0xjmux/ESP-PROG-Adapter/releases/latest)
* This includes an interactive HTML BOM, which makes hand assembly much easier. 

## Versions
### V1.2 - JTAG arrives!
* Added JTAG compatibility headers, extended size of board. 

> [!NOTE]
> As of 11/25/2023, still waiting for boards to arrive so confirm they work; this note should be removed when that takes place.
